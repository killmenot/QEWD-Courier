    Handling the response from /api/openehr/check  (ie response from index.js in this folder)

    So at this point, during the /api/initialise process before login,
    we know the NHS Number exists on OpenEHR

    We'll now retrieve the latest Discovery data for the headings
    we're interested in, and write any new records into EtherCIS

    This is managed by a QEWD-stored mapping document which maps
    Discovery Uids to EtherCIS Uids.  If a mapping doesn't exist,
    then the Discovery record is POSTed to EtherCIS

    Note that the looping through the headings is serialised to
    prevent flooding EtherCIS with simultaneous requests


    The next step in processing the response from this event hook
    is in the "onOrchResponse.js" handler for the "initialise" handler
    in the "auth_service" MicroService - see the callback function
    for the "forwardToMS()" function which forwarded the /api/openehr/check
    request to the OpenEHR MicroService
